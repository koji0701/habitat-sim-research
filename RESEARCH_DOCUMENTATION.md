Here is the documentation for everything created on top of the habitat-sim: 

**habitat-sim/src_python/habitat_sim/agent/controls/programatic_controller.py**
- this creates the '''ProgrammaticController''' class which can be reused anywhere for automatic agent movement

**/habitat-sim/src_python/habitat_sim/agent/controls/programatic_movement_demo.py**
- this is a quick demo of the '''ProgramaticController''' class, with a hard coded path (movement + rotations)
- to run, cd into the controls directory, and run '''python programatic_movement_demo.py'''
